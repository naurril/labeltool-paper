Comments to the author
======================

I very much appreciate the contribution to the annotation
space. I think that making this project open source will
help researchers throughout the space that rely on 3d
boxes. Consider providing a public dataset as well, as
private datasets provide limited benefits to the average
researcher.
I further encourage the authors to ensure continued support
of this tool, which is crucial to the longevity and overall
impact of such tools. In the process, consider specific
tools to help in sequential scenes with potentially
multiple overlapping sensor fields that can never perfectly
align in time.
I appreciate the solid organization of the paper and the
clarity in purpose and writing.
