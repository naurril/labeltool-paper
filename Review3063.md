Comments to the author
======================

The paper is well written and makes significant
technological contributions. Some minor comments,
suggestions and improvements are provided below:

- ~~In the abstract, change "The novelty of this work
includes threefolds" to "The novelty of this work is
threefolds".~~ //ok
- ~~In the abstract, change "The experiment results show" to
"The experimental results show". //ok~~
- ~~In the abstract, change "annotation accuracy and
efficiency pretty much compared" to "annotation accuracy
and efficiency compared". //ok~~
- ~~In Table I, if possible include a column for open source
(or not) platforms. //ok~~
- ~~In Table I, some cells are left empty. What does that
denote? Replace empty cells with "x" or "-". //ok~~
- ~~In Table I, how is "n/a" different from "x"? If
possible, replace "n/a" with existing symbols. //ok~~
- The proposed platform is said to be capable of using AI
algorithms for automatic pre-annotating. Does this mean
that the platform requires hardware like GPUs or is it that
the platform can use already generated results from AI
algorithms? If yes, please provide more details on the
computational requirements.
- ~~In Section III A, correct "fronend" to "frontend". //ok~~
- The proposed platform seems to only be capable of
transferring labels from one another within the same
modality, but not between modalities, for example, from
camera to LiDAR and vice versa. Some clarification on this
would be appreciated. If you can also include a column for
annotation transfer between modalities in Table I, that
would be great.
- ~~In Section III B, change "Multiple camera images can be
all displayed" to "Multiple camera images can all be
displayed". //ok~~
- In Section III D equations 1-6, B_t, B_r and B_w are
said to be coordinate systems but are used as
transformations. Please clarify their definition and
differentiate between coordinate systems and
transformations.
- ~~In Section IV B, the authors mention that the "original
KITTI labels are not suited as ground truth due to their
accuracy not high enough". I don't think that is a valid
claim as KITTI is known for having high quality
annotations. The authors should provide evidence to support
this claim or should compare with original KITTI ground
truth.~~ //ok
- ~~In Section IV B, replace "The success should attribute
to" to "The success can be attributed to". //ok~~
- ~~In the Conclusion, the authors claim to have tested
their platform on nuScenes. However, they have not provided
any experiments on nuScenes. The authors should remove
nuScenes from their Conclusion.  //ok~~
