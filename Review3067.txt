Reviewer 3 of IV 2020 submission 429

Comments to the author
======================

The authors present POINTS, a new open source software for
3D point cloud labeling. The paper is well written and easy
to understand.
The main contribution is the software itself, together with
a good visualization and some heuristics to make the box
labeling fast and easy.
The evaluation makes sense but it would be nice to have
more software packages as comparison. Also an ablation
study would be interesting to see which ideas contribute
the most to the improved performance (compared to the
baseline).
